### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've always been interested in computers and technology , that is why I decided to find out more
 about it. I've recently finished Henry Bootcamp , which consists on 800+ hours covering many technologies:
* HTML
* CSS / Bootstrap
* Javascript
* React / Redux
* Postgres
* Sequelize

I'm open to work , looking forward to get my first IT job
